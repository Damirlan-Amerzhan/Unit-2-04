    <p style="font-size:70%">My thoughts<br>on the<br>school.</p>
    <pre style="font-size:60%">
      <br>I think the school is a pretty nice place.
      <br>The community there is nice and every there is supportive.
      <br>The school it self is quite big and feels as if I'm home. 
      <br>I do think the school could use more extra-curricular activities. 
      <br>An example being fields trips. 
      <br>But overall, Holy Trinity High School is a school that I keep close to my heart.
